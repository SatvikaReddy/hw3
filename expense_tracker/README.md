# hw1- Manual Review

The homework will be based on this project named "Expense Tracker",where users will be able to add/remove daily transaction. 

## Compile

To compile the code from terminal, use the following command:
```
cd src
javac ExpenseTrackerApp.java
java ExpenseTracker
```

You should be able to view the GUI of the project upon successful compilation. 

## Java Version
This code is compiled with ```openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18```. Please update your JDK accordingly if you face any incompatibility issue.


Added Undo functionality- A user can select a row and click on undo to remove that particular transaction. If we try to undo when there are no rows or without selecting a row, the app will not let us do so and throw an error/ pop up message.
